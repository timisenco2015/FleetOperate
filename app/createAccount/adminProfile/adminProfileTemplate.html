                  <p>Protecting your privacy is really important to us. Accordingly, we're providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services (as defined in our Terms of Service). This Privacy Policy applies only to those websites, services and applications included within "Services" and doesn't apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services or the practices of companies that we don't own or control or people we don't manage. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.</p>
                  <p>How do we collect and use information?</p>
                  <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>
                  <p>Account Information and Information You Provide Us. When you create an Account we'll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, phone number, email address, and office addresses ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII"). We may also collect certain information that is not PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, such as your DOT number, carrier name and cycle rule. Further, we receive and store any other information that you knowingly provide to us.</p>
                  <p>Information Collected Using Cookies. We collect certain information through the use of "cookies," which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you've logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don't accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.</p>
                  <p>In the event that we send you any offers for services or products provided by our partners or affiliates or you click a link to one of our partners' or business affiliates' or other third parties' websites or services, such partner, affiliated business or other third party may also transmit cookies to your browser or device. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, partners or business affiliates, and we are not responsible for their privacy policies and practices.</p>
                  <p>Information Related to Use of the Services. Our servers automatically record certain information about how Account holders, and any other End Users, ("Users") use our Services (we refer to this information as "Log Data"). Log Data may include information such as a User's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, the links on our Services that a User clicked on, driving logs entered into the Services, documents uploaded to the Services, messages exchanged on the Services and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties, such as Google Analytics, to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users' needs and preferences. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, click here, and to learn how to opt out of that service click here. We may use a person's IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p>
                  <p>Location Information. In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation or through GPS or wireless network triangulation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you (for example, by helping you complete your driving logs).</p>
                  <p>Communications and Offers. We may communicate with you via email or through the Services. For example, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about the use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive email communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing info@FleetOperate.com.</p>
                  <p>What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</p>
                  <p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:</p>
                  <p>Information Shared with Our Service Providers. We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party service providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose. For example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our service providers do not have any right to use the PII or any of Your Data that we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>
                  <p>Information Shared with Third Parties. We may share aggregated information and non-identifying or de-identified information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes. We share your driving logs and documents only with your consent (e.g., with those user you connect with on the Services or share Your Data with via email or fax from the Services).</p>
                  <p>Information Shared with Affiliated Businesses and Partners. In certain situations, businesses or third party websites with whom we've partnered or affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us) or we may provide the Services in connection with such partner or affiliated business' other products and services. In the event that you are receiving products or services from one of our partners or affiliated businesses, we may share Your Data and/or your PII for such services to be provided. For example, we may partner with a business who needs access to your driving data and your PII in order to provide you with certain fueling or insurance services, or we may partner with a reseller of our products and services from whom you are receiving other products and services.</p>
                  <p>We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to a partner or affiliated website or business, please review all such business' or websites' policies and any agreements between you and such affiliated website, partner or business.</p>
                  <p>If you authorize us to, consent to us to, or otherwise select or use a third-party service for which we deem it necessary to share your PII or Your Data with a third-party, affiliated business or partner through the Site or the Services, we may share your PII or Your Data.</p>
                  <p>Further, if you authorize or consent to a third party's receipt Your Data or your PII, we may rely on a representation from that third party that you have authorized such third party to receive Your Data or your PII.</p>
                  <p>User Profiles and Submissions. Your user profile information contains your name, location, email address and phone number associated with your Account and profile ("User Profile Information"). This User Profile Information may be displayed to other users, such as Fleet Users, with whom you connect. Your name and User Profile Information may also be displayed to others when you send messages through the Services. We do not control the policies and practices of any of our users, Fleet Users or any other third party sites or services.</p>
                  <p>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII and Your Data may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>
                  <p>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. It is our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government, and to contest claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, it is also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (i) to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation or legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the rights, property and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (iv) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.</p>
                  <p>The Security of Your Information</p>
                  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>
                  <p>We use Amazon's S3 storage service to store some of your information (for example, your documents). You can find more information on Amazon's data security from the S3 FAQs.</p>
                  <p>Links to Other Sites</p>
                  <p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we're not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.</p>
                  <p>Modifying Your Information</p>
                  <p>You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by changing your "account settings" on the Site or the App. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at info@FleetOperate.com with your request. We'll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p>
                  <p>International Transfer</p>
                  <p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you're located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of any PII represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
                  <p>Our Policy Toward Children</p>
                  <p>As noted in our Terms of Services, our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p>
                  <p>Changes to Privacy Policy</p>
                  <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services and provide our users with more features. Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll notify you of such changes by posting them on the Site or by sending you an email or other notification, and we'll indicate when such changes will become effective. Please note that if you've opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven't provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the FleetOperate by Jackfruit Systems Inc. ("FleetOperate", “Jackfruit Systems” "we" or "us") website located at fleetoperate.com (the "Site"). Please read these Terms of Service (the "Terms") carefully because they govern your use of our Service (as defined below). By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms, with your agreement being further specified in Section 2. Please contact us with any questions at info@fleetoperate.com.</p>
        <p>1. Description of Service</p>
        <p>1.1. The "Service(s)" means FleetOperate's electronic logs and fleet management software (including the Site, our mobile device application ("App"), and any software embedded in the Vehicle Bus Adapter and Electronic Logging Device) ("Software"), the hardware (including the Vehicle Bus Adapter, Electronic Logging Device / FleetOperate Tablet, cables, display devices, and accessories) ("Hardware"), the Premier Services (as defined in Section 9 of these Terms), and all of Our Content (as defined below). The Service does not include Your Data (as defined below) or any software application or service that is provided by you or a third party, which you use in connection with the Service, whether or not FleetOperate designates them as official integrations (each a "Non-FleetOperate Product"). Any modifications and new features added to the Service are also subject to these Terms. All rights, title and interest in and to the Service and its components (including all intellectual property rights) will remain with and belong exclusively to Jackfruit Systems, including the rights to any text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, documents, works of authorship of any kind, de-identified and aggregated data collected by the Services, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available by us through the Services ("Our Content").</p>
        <p>2. Agreement to Terms</p>
        <p>2.1. BY USING OUR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS INCLUDING ANY POLICIES OR OTHER TERMS REFERENCED IN OR INCORPORATED BY THESE TERMS (SUCH AS OUR PRIVACY POLICY). BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, SIGNING UP FOR AN ACCOUNT (AS DEFINED BELOW) OR BY EXECUTING AN ORDER FORM, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF ORDERING THE  SERVICES, THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>
        <p>2.2. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE LOCATED IN SECTION 13 OF THESE TERMS, AS IT REQUIRES ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, IN MOST CASES, ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS AND CLASS ACTIONS.</p>
        <p>3. Your Access and Use of the Services</p>
        <p>3.1. You may access and use the Services only for lawful, authorized purposes and you shall not misuse the Services in any manner (as determined by Jackfruit Systems in its sole discretion). See Section 11 below for further provisions outlining prohibited uses of the Services. You shall comply with any codes of conduct, policies, storage limitations, or other notices Jackfruit Systems provides you or publishes in connection with the Services from time to time, but if any of those policies materially change the Terms, we will provide you with reasonable notice as provided in Section 5 below.</p>
        <p>3.2. Any Software or Hardware or any of Our Content that may be made available by or on behalf of Jackfruit Systems in connection with the Service contains proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws. Subject to these Terms, Jackfruit Systems only grants you a personal, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive and revocable license to use the object code of any Software solely in connection with the Service. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.</p>
        <p>3.3. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Jackfruit Systems grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable license to download and install a copy of the App on a mobile device or computer that you own or control and to run such copy of the App. Jackfruit Systems reserves all rights in and to the App not expressly granted to you under these Terms.</p>
        <p>3.4. You may not share your Account information with, or allow access to your Account by, any third party. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your access credentials, whether or not a third party accesses your Account.</p>
        <p>3.5.

"Your Data" includes logs you create, location coordinates that are collected, messages you send, documents you upload, profile information and anything else you enter or upload into the Service.

As between Jackfruit Systems and you, you are only granting us the rights and licenses necessary to provide our Services to you and any other services for which you have signed up through any of our resellers, business partners and affiliated businesses. In order for us to provide the Services to you, we need to be able to transmit, store and copy Your Data in order to display it to you and to those with whom you share it, to index it so you are able to search it, to make backups to prevent data loss, to send your submissions and messages through our platform, and so on.</p>

        <p>Your acceptance of these Terms gives us the permission to do so and grants us any such rights and licenses necessary to provide the Service to you, and any other services or products for which you have signed up through any of our resellers, business partners and affiliated businesses. For example, if you have agreed to share any of Your Data, or any other data we collect in connection with your use of the Services, with one of our partners or affiliates or other third party, you grant us the rights and licenses to share or deliver such data. This permission includes allowing us to use third-party service providers (such as Amazon Web Services) in the operation and administration of the Service and the rights granted to us are extended to these third parties to the degree necessary in order for the Service to be provided.</p>
        <p>If you authorize a third party to receive Your Data, we may provide Your Data to a third party. If we have an agreement with such third party to market the Services or otherwise provide services or products to you, either jointly or separately, we may rely on a representation from that third party that you have authorized such third party to receive Your Data.</p>
        <p>For clarification purposes, you grant us the necessary licenses to Your Data for us to create aggregated and de-identified data for our use in providing the Services and otherwise. Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, we may use and sell such aggregated and de-identified data, which is compiled from our users, and does not directly identify you, for any purpose we see fit.</p>

        <p>4.4. You are solely responsible for your conduct (including by and between all users), the content of Your Data, and all communications with others while using the Services. You represent and warrant that you own all Your Data or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in Your Data under these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither Your Data, nor your use and provision of Your Data, nor any use of Your Data by Jackfruit Systems on or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation. We are not responsible for the accuracy, appropriateness, or legality of Your Data or any other information you and your users may be able to access using the Services. Should you be in violation of these Terms, we have the right to remove any of Your Data causing such violation.</p>
        <p>4.5. The Services provide features that allow you and your End Users to share Your Data and other materials with others. When you choose to share Your Data through our Services, you are granting us the necessary rights and licenses to do so. Please consider carefully what you allow to be shared.</p>

        <p>5. Changes and Modifications to Terms of Service</p>
        <p>5.1. We may modify these Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we'll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It's important that you review the modified Terms because if you continue to use the Services after we've let you know that the Terms have been modified, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms then you may no longer use the Services. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>6. Limitations on Services and Third-Party Relationships</p>

Jackfruit Systems acts only as an interface to facilitate -- not to direct or control -- communications between users of Jackfruit Systems’ Services.</p>

        <p>8. Warnings and Awareness About Connections Between Drivers and Companies</p>
        <p>8.1. The Services enable a commercial motor vehicle driver ("Driver") to connect directly with a motor carrier ("Company"), allowing Drivers to send messages and automatically share their driving logs, documents, location information and other data ("Driver Data") with the Company. When Drivers connect with a Company through the Services, the Company's employees and other third parties who are also connected to that Company ("FleetOperate Users") may access Driver Data for all Drivers who are connected to that same Company.</p>
        <p>8.2. If a Driver connects with a Company, the Driver should be aware that the Driver's Driver Data will be automatically shared with that Company and its FleetOperate Users and that Company and its FleetOperate Users will be able to send messages to that Driver. Please consider carefully the parties with whom you choose to connect and what you choose to share. FleetOperate's role in this process is solely to provide the technology and platform that enables these Services. Please see Sections 3 & 4, above, and Section 11, below, as well as the rest of these Terms, for further specific provisions outlining your responsibility for anything shared through the Services.</p>
        <p>9. Services and Hardware</p>
        <p>The following provisions of this Section 9 apply to you only if you have a direct billing relationship with FleetOperate for Services and/or Hardware. If you have entered into an agreement for the provision of services and hardware with a reseller or other third party and have a direct billing relationship with such reseller or third party, please refer to the provisions of that agreement for your rights and obligations with respect to such payment and other arrangements for services and hardware. If you have entered into an agreement for the provision of services and hardware with a third party, however, you are still bound by the rest of these Terms of Service if you use any of the Services.</p>
        <p>If you have purchased any FleetOperate Hardware from us or a reseller, please refer to the Hardware Warranty available at FleetOperate.com (the "Hardware Warranty") for further terms related to your FleetOperate Electronic Logging Device.</p>
        <p>9.1. Description of Services. FleetOperate offers paid Services, description of the Services is available at FleetOperate.com website. In order to request Services, you must submit and agree to the terms of an order form, or other form of communication for ordering the Services from FleetOperate, as applicable, which is subject to Jackfruit Systems’ acceptance. Jackfruit Systems reserves the right to refuse any Order Form, and receipt of an Order Form is not considered acceptance of such Order Form. To the extent you use any of our Services, you will be required to provide Jackfruit Systems accurate information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument (a "Payment Method"). You will promptly update your Account information with any changes in your Payment Method. If you do not update your Account with changes in your Payment Method, we may suspend or terminate your subscription to the Services. If any of the Services which you are currently using are free, we will notify you before any such Services become paid Services and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.</p>
        <p>9.2. Payment</p>
        <p>9.2.1. Pricing and Payments. Upon acceptance of your Order Form by Jackfruit Systems, you agree to pay Jackfruit Systems in accordance with the terms set forth on your Order Form and the terms of this Agreement, and you authorize FleetOperate to bill your Payment Method in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with such terms. Please be aware that the pricing for the Services will be governed by the terms in your Order Form, upon acceptance by Jackfruit Systems, and not the pricing set forth at FleetOperate.com. Unless otherwise agreed to by you and Jackfruit Systems, any additional Hardware or Services orders during a subscription term for Services--either through email, self-service, or other method--will be subject to the same terms and pricing as in your Order Form for the remainder of your then-current subscription term.</p>
        <p>9.2.2. Billing Arrangement. We use a third-party payment processor (the "Payment Processor") to bill you through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your "Billing Account") for use of the Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to bill your Payment Method. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>
        <p>9.2.3. Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</p>
        <p>9.2.4. Recurring Billing. Some of the Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, EMAIL info@FLEETOPERATE.COM.</p>
        <p>9.2.5. Change in Amount Authorized. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p>
        <p>9.2.6. Billing Disputes. If you dispute any charges you must let Jackfruit Systems know within sixty (60) days after the date that Jackfruit Systems invoices you. All amounts paid are non-refundable and we reserve the right to change our prices in the future. Jackfruit Systems may choose to bill you through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued must be received by the date specified in the invoice. Past due fees are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection.</p>
        <p>9.2.7. Taxes. You are responsible to pay any and all taxes that we may be required to collect or pay based on providing the Services other than taxes based on our net income.</p>
        <p>9.2.8. Discontinuation of Services. If you choose to discontinue, cancel or terminate any Services for which you have agreed to on an Order Form before the end of the term agreed to in such Order Form, Jackfruit Systems shall have the right to immediately charge the Payment Method associated with your Account for the remaining balance due with respect to the agreed upon Term of your Services, all as further specified in your Order Form or in any agreements to extend the initial term of your Order Form.</p>
        <p>9.2.9. AUTO-RENEWAL FOR SERVICES. Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done by emailing us at info@FleetOperate.comor by calling us at 888-849-5477, any Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. If you terminate a Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-agreement term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-agreement term expires. However, you won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-agreement subscription period.</p>
        <p>9.2.10. Reaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination or continued use of any Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Service.</p>
        <p>9.2.11. Free Trials and Other Promotions. Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Service, please contact us at info@FleetOperate.com or at 888-849-5477.</p>

Within 30 days of receipt of the replacement Hardware you must, at your own expense, uninstall, package and return the defective Hardware to FleetOperate.

In the event that, within 30 days of receipt of an Original Cable Set, you discover that we have sent you either a defective Original Cable Set or an Original Cable Set that is incompatible with your vehicle(s) due to our error in interpreting the cable set which you specified when you requested the  Services (e.g., we sent you a 6-pin cable set when you requested a 9-pin cable set), you may, within 30 days after receipt of the Original Cable Set, request a replacement set of cables without charge (each replacement set a "Replacement Cable Set"). If after 30 days of receipt of the Original Cable Set, you request a Replacement Cable Set, we will charge you $30 for each such Replacement Cable Set that we deliver to you. If the Original Cable Set is the incorrect cable set for your vehicle(s) due to no fault of FleetOperate, you may order cable sets from us, and we will charge you $30 for each extra cable set delivered to you. We reserve the right to charge these fees to the credit or debit card or other payment instrument that you have on file with us.</p>
